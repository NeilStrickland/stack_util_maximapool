The list of things to do:

1. File transfer for remote servlets.
 - We wish to run maxima on remote machine that does not share the filesystem of the moodle server.
 - Files generated by the maxima process must be identified and returned in the response.
  + Work files must be thrown away, work and output directories are different things...
 - When servlet runs on the same filesystem we do not want to send the files through the servlet. Important for small scale ( <500 students and so on).

  The plan for 1.
  - Add a template for running a command after the load process is done, the template has two parameters $WORK_DIR and $OUTPUT_DIR e.g.
     post.load.execute = TMP_IMG_DIR: "$WORK_DIR"; IMG_DIR: "$OUTPUT_DIR";
  - Both dirs are process specific and destroyed after process/repsonse closes.
  - Response is either text/plain or application/zip type, if files need to be transferred we use Zip and store the normal output in file named OUTPUT.
  - There will be a switch "file_handling = true|false" that defines if we create those work directories for processes and if we do the Zipping up when needed.
  - If timed out all files will be zipped and transferred no matter how baddly formed.

2. Health check page.
 - Runs the startup of a process synchronously with debug feedback.


Low priority, as in maybe someone else handles these:
 - Encoding issues, the response should tell which encoding is used for the text and we would need to keep track on it when handling the processes.
